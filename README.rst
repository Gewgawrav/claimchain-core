A core and experimental implementation of ClaimChain, a cryptographic data
structure. See the `web page <https://claimchain.github.io>`_ to learn about
ClaimChain.

Check out the `documentation <https://claimchain-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.

Usage warning
*************

This code is made for research purposes. It is not to be used in real-world systems.
Not all security features are implemented, and some of the cryptographic instantiations
need to be changed to more secure alternatives.
